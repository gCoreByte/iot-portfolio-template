# Module 1

## Task Inspirations

- I think IoT and data in general is cool. I'm especially interested in swarms with no central server.

## Task Personal Profile

Who am I?
1. What type of programming experience do I have?
   Mostly web development, but also some level of systems programming and as well as working with microcontrollers in previous courses.
2. Microcontrollers?
   Arduino, home automation as well as coursework in university.
3. Single board computers?
   Rasp pi only
4. Maker community?
   Not a part, but I am interested in 3d printing.
5. IoT?
   Quite familiar, has a lot of ties to pervasive data science.
6. Expectations
   Hands-on work with actual physical things. Not very interested in theoretical work.


## Task What is IoT

Domains and included areas:

1. Healthcare, such as wearables
2. Logistics, such as transportation robots in warehouses, the smart tags in stores
3. Agriculture - drones to track plant health, growth
4. Smart cities
5. Smart home automation


Commonly used (data) protocols:

- HTTP
- MQTT

Typical devices (appliance or micro controller):

- Roomba
- Philips Hue
- Smartwatch
- Arduino
- ESP32

Challenges:

- Room air quality monitoring in Delta - How many people in the room on average per lecture, how does the air quality change, can a different size room be used to either improve the air quality or keep it the same while using less space?
- Robotic planter - detect soil moisture, air temperature, light intensity, water reservoir level. Notifications to other device when action is needed.
