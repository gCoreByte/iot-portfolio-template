# Reflection 1 in Module 1

## What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?

It's been many years since I last built a circuit, but after reviewing the slides in class afterwards it was all still very clear to me. Thus I think that if you study something well, you'll always be able to pick it up again very easily later. 

## What was good?

The workbook was very clear on the tasks and how to solve them.

## What was difficult, where did you struggle?

Task 4 was difficult - me and my partner decided to solve it at home later since it was hard to get the software working. 

## Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration? Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors?

It was fun trying out the small controller and building circuits, especially when we encountered the same issue as a few others where if a pin was grounded, it would not boot.

## How was your interaction with peers/instructors?

It was good - my partner and I have had previous courses together too. The instructors were also very helpful in helping us get our kit together and fixing the few issues we had with circuits.

## Help and extra work
### Who helped you, gave feedback, was it valuable?

A lot of help came from the instructors when we were having trouble with the pull-up resistor task, which was very helpful.

### Who did you help, gave feedback to?

I helped my partner with the software side of the tasks as he didn't have experience with it before.

### Did you present, implement, made a PR, or fix something that was crucial for the class in itself?
    
No.
