# Reflection 1 in Module 1

I was pretty surprised to see the overlap in pervasive data science and IoT since it wasn't really something I was expecting, even though in hindsight it's quite obvious. It was also really cool to try to build something with the node based system, but I still prefer writing code directly. I wanted to create a tracker to see all topics with data moving, but getting the node-based system to cooperate was very hard.
The instructors were helpful in getting the workshop to work and I think it would be an interesting post-mortem to see why the password generation failed for certain sticks.

## Notes from class

Who am I?
1. What type of programming experience do I have?
   Mostly web development, but also some level of systems programming and as well as working with microcontrollers in previous courses.
2. Microcontrollers?
   Arduino, home automation as well as coursework in university.
3. Single board computers?
   Rasp pi only
4. Maker community?
   Not a part, but I am interested in 3d printing.
5. IoT?
   Quite familiar, has a lot of ties to pervasive data science.
6. Expectations
   Hands-on work with actual physical things. Not very interested in theoretical work.

What is IoT?
Devices, sensors that have some sort of connectivity.

Domains:
1. Healthcare, such as wearables
2. Logistics, such as transportation robots in warehouses, the smart tags in stores
3. Agriculture - drones to track plant health, growth
4. Smart cities
5. Smart home automation


Data protocols:
1. HTTP
2. MQTT - Message Queuing Telemetry Transport
3. Bluetooth LE

Typical devices:
1. Roomba
2. Smartwatch
3. Arduino
4. ESP32
5. Rasppi

What is challenge based education?
>  Challenge-based Education can be defined as a collaborative and hands-on teaching and learning approach, prompting students to work with peers, teachers, and experts in their communities and around the world to ask good questions, develop deeper subject area knowledge, accept and solve challenges, and share their experience (Nichols & Cator, 2008, p.1)
